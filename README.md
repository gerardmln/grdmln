This website was created by Gerard Angelus L. Malaluan using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, developed within Microsoft Visual Studio. 
Many of the components were inspired by the lessons we covered in class, and I also borrowed a few snippets from my personal 
repository: https://github.com/gerardmln/BOOTSTRAP5

Building this site wasn’t easy. It took time, patience, and plenty of late nights. I ran into a lot of errors and roadblocks, but 
each mistake became a learning opportunity. Tools like GitHub Copilot helped along the way, especially with debugging and code 
suggestions, but I made sure to understand the logic behind everything I wrote.

One moment that really stuck with me was when I had trouble adding third-party fonts, a small issue but one that taught me a 
big lesson. As Sir Jei wisely said, "You’ll really learn from your mistakes." He also reminded us, "hindi puro gpt ng gpt," a 
humorous but true reminder to not rely solely on AI and to make sure we’re actually learning the craft.

I also discovered a cool trick while working on the site: you can use a GIF as a background to create a short, looping 
video effect. It’s a fun way to add movement and personality to your website.
